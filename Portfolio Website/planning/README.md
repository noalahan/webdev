# Portfolio Planning

1. What is your website about? is it directed to a particular field or industry?
   > My website is about my professional profile, almost like a resume or a CV. It will be directed at the computer industry, specifically computer science, animation, or graphic design.
2. Audience. Who are your visitors and what information will they be looking for?
   > My audience are job recruiters or potential bosses. They will be looking for my ability, experience, projects, and (professional) contact information (eg linkedin, email, etc)
3. What existing websites perform a similar function?
   > Portfolio websites and personal websites.

## Wireframe Notes

> Every page will share the same color scheme. All second level sites will have the same layout with only a few differences in some of the background elements. The mobile view will be the same design but simply taller.
