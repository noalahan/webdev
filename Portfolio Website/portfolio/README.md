# Portfolio Planning

My portfolio website is designed to look like a building, with each navigation leading the viewer into one of the rooms/floors. Click on each window to navigate between the rooms.

### Other features to look out for

- A "logo" with my initials in the tab next to the title of the page.
- Parallax scrolling (two layers of clouds, skyline, and main building).
- Various easter eggs, mostly leading to other weekly tasks, some just for fun. Try clicking around the website on different elements.
- Resizeable. Try resizing the window on your computer, or switch over to your phone, to see how the layout on the main page changes (my name at the top, the number of windows, etc.), and to see the pictures the individual pages reveal when they are in portrait mode.
- All the data in the room pages is loaded asynchornously from a google sheets page and can all be updated.
- All the elements were drawn by me for this website.
- The stairs placement is calculated with javascript, which will allow me to add as many windows (aka, additional pages) as needed.
- The background colors of squares in various pages are picked randomly. Try to reload the page and see them change.
- My dog Nella resting in the About Me page:)

# Portfolio Planning (from formative assignment)

1. What is your website about? is it directed to a particular field or industry?
   > My website is about my professional profile, almost like a resume or a CV. It will be directed at the computer industry, specifically computer science, animation, or graphic design.
2. Audience. Who are your visitors and what information will they be looking for?
   > My audience are job recruiters or potential bosses. They will be looking for my ability, experience, projects, and (professional) contact information (eg linkedin, email, etc)
3. What existing websites perform a similar function?
   > Portfolio websites and personal websites.

## Wireframe Notes

> Every page will share the same color scheme. All second level sites will have the same layout with only a few differences in some of the background elements. The mobile view will be the same design but simply taller.
